    question: "What is the difference between ceramics and porcelain tiles?",
    answer:
      "Ceramic and porcelain are both types of clay-based materials used in tile production, but there are some key differences between them. These differences relate to their composition, manufacturing process, physical characteristics, and recommended applications.Ceramic tiles: Ceramic tiles are typically made from a mixture of clay, minerals, and water. The clay used in ceramic tiles is generally of lower density and may include a higher percentage of impurities. Porcelain tiles are made from a more refined and dense form of clay known as porcelain clay. This clay has a lower water absorption rate compared to ceramic clay, and it contains a higher proportion of fine minerals like kaolin.",
