From the first day of demolition to the final walk-through, your bathroom renovation could take a bit less — or substantially more — time than average.

 Some bathrooms may take as little as 3-4 weeks to finish, while others take 9-10 weeks, or even longer.

Ceramics and porcelain are both types of ceramic materials, but there are some differences between them. 

Porcelain is a subtype of ceramic that is more refined and has a higher density than traditional ceramics. It is fired at a higher temperature, which results in a harder and more durable material. 

Porcelain also has a lower water absorption rate compared to ceramics, making it more suitable for areas with high moisture, such as bathrooms or kitchens.

 Additionally, porcelain often has a more consistent color and can be made to mimic other materials like stone or wood.

In general, it is not recommended to place new tiles directly on top of
existing tiles. Tiling over existing tiles can result in several issues:

1.  Height and Leveling: Adding another layer of tiles on top of
    existing ones can create an uneven surface, especially if the
    existing tiles are not perfectly level. This can lead to an
    unprofessional and unstable final result.

2.  Weight and Load: Every layer of tiles adds weight to the floor or
    wall. Adding extra weight by placing new tiles on top of existing
    ones can put additional stress on the structure. It's essential to
    consider the load-bearing capacity of the underlying surface before
    adding another layer.

3.  Adhesion and Durability: The adhesive used for tiling may not bond
    well to the existing tiles, especially if they have a glossy or
    sealed surface. Over time, the new tiles may start to come loose or
    crack due to poor adhesion.

4.  Door Clearances: Adding another layer of tiles can increase the
    thickness of the floor or wall, potentially affecting door
    clearances. This can result in doors not opening or closing
    properly.

If you're considering retiling an area, it is generally recommended to
remove the existing tiles before installing new ones. Removing the old
tiles provides a clean and level surface, allows for proper preparation,
and ensures a better overall outcome. It may require some additional
effort, but it's a more reliable approach to achieve a satisfactory
result.

Ceramic tiles can have varying degrees of slip resistance, depending on their surface texture and finish.

While some ceramic tiles may have a smooth and glossy surface, which can be more slippery, there are also options available that offer increased traction to reduce the risk of slipping.

Yes, ceramic tile is known for its durability.

It is a robust and long-lasting material, making it a popular choice for flooring and wall applications in both residential and commercial settings.
 
Its resistance to scratches, stains, and moisture, coupled with its ability to withstand heavy foot traffic, makes ceramic tile a durable option for various areas of the home or workplace.
